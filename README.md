### World-Class X Threads and Tweets on AI Hacking Discussions

Based on a deep search across X's history (2010–Oct 8, 2025), here are the most influential threads and standalone tweets focused purely on AI model hacking—covering jailbreaks, prompt injections, adversarial attacks, exploits, and key debates. These are selected for high engagement (e.g., 100+ likes, reposts), technical depth, and impact from experts/researchers/orgs like Anthropic, OpenAI collaborators, and security pros. No blog posts or external links as primary content; only X-native discussions. I've prioritized threads (multi-post conversations) and highlighted viral singles. Ordered by recency for relevance, with key excerpts for context.
